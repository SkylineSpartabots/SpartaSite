            Being part of a FIRST robotics team is fun! You'll gain experiences
            with many other students with similar interests.

            <br />
            It doesn't matter whether you are experienced with robots or not,
            you'll gain amazing experiences because your critical thinking, time
            management and reasoning are tested in a time-critical, team-based
            environment. You'll be able to carry these skills to college, and
            robotics club also looks great on college applications.

              The best way to join Skyline Robotics is to come see us at the
              club fair! <br />
              <br />
              At our exhibit, you'll get information about what robotics is and
              when the first meeting is. Just attend that first meeting, and
              you're in! There is no prior experience required, so anyone can
              join.

              Feel free to come to any meetings. We like to see regular
              commitment, but we understand you have busy lives as students. You
              don't have to attend every meeting, but both the club and your
              learning benefits from regular attendance. We also hope that
              the meetings are something you would want to go to!
